def list_folder(self, path):
    '\n        Return a list of files within a given folder.  The C{path} will use\n        posix notation (C{"/"} separates folder names) and may be an absolute\n        or relative path.\n\n        The list of files is expected to be a list of L{SFTPAttributes}\n        objects, which are similar in structure to the objects returned by\n        C{os.stat}.  In addition, each object should have its C{filename}\n        field filled in, since this is important to a directory listing and\n        not normally present in C{os.stat} results.  The method\n        L{SFTPAttributes.from_stat} will usually do what you want.\n\n        In case of an error, you should return one of the C{SFTP_*} error\n        codes, such as L{SFTP_PERMISSION_DENIED}.\n\n        @param path: the requested path (relative or absolute) to be listed.\n        @type path: str\n        @return: a list of the files in the given folder, using\n            L{SFTPAttributes} objects.\n        @rtype: list of L{SFTPAttributes} I{or error code}\n        \n        @note: You should normalize the given C{path} first (see the\n        C{os.path} module) and check appropriate permissions before returning\n        the list of files.  Be careful of malicious clients attempting to use\n        relative paths to escape restricted folders, if you\'re doing a direct\n        translation from the SFTP server path to your local filesystem.\n        '
