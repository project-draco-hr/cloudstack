def rename(self, oldpath, newpath):
    '\n        Rename (or move) a file.  The SFTP specification implies that this\n        method can be used to move an existing file into a different folder,\n        and since there\'s no other (easy) way to move files via SFTP, it\'s\n        probably a good idea to implement "move" in this method too, even for\n        files that cross disk partition boundaries, if at all possible.\n        \n        @note: You should return an error if a file with the same name as\n            C{newpath} already exists.  (The rename operation should be\n            non-desctructive.)\n\n        @param oldpath: the requested path (relative or absolute) of the\n            existing file.\n        @type oldpath: str\n        @param newpath: the requested new path of the file.\n        @type newpath: str\n        @return: an SFTP error code like L{SFTP_OK}.\n        @rtype: int\n        '
