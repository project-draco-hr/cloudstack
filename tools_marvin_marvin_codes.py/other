'\n@Desc     : This module defines all codes, constants maintained globally             and used across marvin and its test features.The main purpose             is to maintain readability, maintain one common place for             all codes used or reused across test features. It enhances             maintainability and readability. Users just import statement             to receive all the codes mentioned here. EX: Here, we define             a code viz., ENABLED  with value "Enabled",then using             this code in a sample feature say test_a.py as below. \n            from codes import *\n            if obj.getvalue() == ENABLED\n\n@DateAdded: 20th October 2013\n'
