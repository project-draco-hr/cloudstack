def add_server_key(self, key):
    '\n        Add a host key to the list of keys used for server mode.  When behaving\n        as a server, the host key is used to sign certain packets during the\n        SSH2 negotiation, so that the client can trust that we are who we say\n        we are.  Because this is used for signing, the key must contain private\n        key info, not just the public half.  Only one key of each type (RSA or\n        DSS) is kept.\n\n        @param key: the host key to add, usually an L{RSAKey <rsakey.RSAKey>} or\n            L{DSSKey <dsskey.DSSKey>}.\n        @type key: L{PKey <pkey.PKey>}\n        '
