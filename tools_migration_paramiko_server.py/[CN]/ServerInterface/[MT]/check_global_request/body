def check_global_request(self, kind, msg):
    "\n        Handle a global request of the given C{kind}.  This method is called\n        in server mode and client mode, whenever the remote host makes a global\n        request.  If there are any arguments to the request, they will be in\n        C{msg}.\n\n        There aren't any useful global requests defined, aside from port\n        forwarding, so usually this type of request is an extension to the\n        protocol.\n\n        If the request was successful and you would like to return contextual\n        data to the remote host, return a tuple.  Items in the tuple will be\n        sent back with the successful result.  (Note that the items in the\n        tuple can only be strings, ints, longs, or bools.)\n\n        The default implementation always returns C{False}, indicating that it\n        does not support any global requests.\n        \n        @note: Port forwarding requests are handled separately, in\n            L{check_port_forward_request}.\n\n        @param kind: the kind of global request being made.\n        @type kind: str\n        @param msg: any extra arguments to the request.\n        @type msg: L{Message}\n        @return: C{True} or a tuple of data if the request was granted;\n            C{False} otherwise.\n        @rtype: bool\n        "
