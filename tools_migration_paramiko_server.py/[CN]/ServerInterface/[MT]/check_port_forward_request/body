def check_port_forward_request(self, address, port):
    '\n        Handle a request for port forwarding.  The client is asking that\n        connections to the given address and port be forwarded back across\n        this ssh connection.  An address of C{"0.0.0.0"} indicates a global\n        address (any address associated with this server) and a port of C{0}\n        indicates that no specific port is requested (usually the OS will pick\n        a port).\n        \n        The default implementation always returns C{False}, rejecting the\n        port forwarding request.  If the request is accepted, you should return\n        the port opened for listening.\n        \n        @param address: the requested address\n        @type address: str\n        @param port: the requested port\n        @type port: int\n        @return: the port number that was opened for listening, or C{False} to\n            reject\n        @rtype: int\n        '
    return False
